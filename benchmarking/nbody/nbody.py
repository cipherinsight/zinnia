# Source: NPBench nbody (nbody_numpy.py)
# Original signature: nbody(mass, pos, vel, N, Nt, dt, G, softening) — mass (N,1), pos/vel (N,3) float arrays.
# Migration notes:
#   - N, Nt hoisted to module-level constants. N from the "S" preset (25) shrunk to 16; NT shrunk to 4.
#   - Helpers getAcc and getEnergy kept as plain functions (no decorator).
#   - Uses np.hstack, np.triu, boolean mask in-place writes (inv_r3[inv_r3 > 0] = ...) — some ops may be unsupported.
