# Zinnia benchmark contract draft: generated for review.
# Keep kernel body faithful; refine TODO contracts before final benchmark runs.
# Categories: data-dependent-loop, in-place-mutation, loop-bounded
# Expected outcome: diagnostic/fail-closed candidate
# Precondition: Add an explicit iteration cap or classify as fail-closed until a bound is available.
# Precondition: Loop trip counts must be finite and tied to scalar bounds or array dimensions.
# Precondition: Use writable fixed/bounded array shapes and record an aliasing policy for mutated inputs.
# Diagnostic: while loops require a public/padded maximum iteration count.
